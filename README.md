# BuddyBoss Group Tabs Manager

Add fully customizable tabs to your BuddyBoss group pages. Whether you're looking to insert Elementor content, redirect to a URL, or embed a shortcode, this plugin gives group admins full control over their group navigation.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Group-Specific Tabs**  
  Add, remove, and edit tabs directly from the *Group Settings* area. Each group manages its own tabs independently.

- **Flexible Content Sources**
  - **Elementor Saved Section** – Display any saved section using Elementor (no Pro required).
  - **External URL** – Redirect the tab to any external or internal link.
  - **Custom Shortcode** – Output shortcode-based content directly in the tab area.

- **Visibility Settings**
  Control who sees each tab:
  - Everyone
  - Logged-in Users
  - Group Members
  - Group Admins
  - Group Moderators
  - No one (useful for drafts or inactive tabs)

- **Drag & Drop Tab Order**
  Use the WordPress Customizer to reorder group tabs visually.

  No need for Elementor Pro—this works with the free version of Elementor.

- **No Bloat / GPL Licensed**
  Lightweight codebase. Fully open-source under the GPLv2 license. Support and updates are available with a paid license, but the core plugin remains free.
